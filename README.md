Kaggle competition - The nature conservancy fisheries monitoring

In this competition, The Nature Conservancy asks you to help them detect which species of fish appears on a fishing boat, based on images captured from boat cameras of various angles.  

The goal is to predict the likelihood of fish species in each picture.

Eight target categories are available in this dataset: Albacore tuna, Bigeye tuna, Yellowfin tuna, Mahi Mahi, Opah, Sharks, Other (meaning that there are fish present but not in the above categories), and No Fish (meaning that no fish is in the picture). Each image has only one fish category, except that there are sometimes very small fish in the pictures that are used as bait.
